# Windicss underline issue

Barebones sveltekit project.  Windicss is already set up.  Do a git clone, and and then 
`npm install

npm run dev -- --open`

should open up the index page. The "This Should be underlined" has a `underline-green-500` class on it, but nothing gets applied. Everything else works as far as I know, just some specific typography stuff doesn't.
